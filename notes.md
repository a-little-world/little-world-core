### Package considerations

#### Displaying graph schemas

We ultimately went with: [`django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs) cause it shows more model info. But [`django-schema-graph`](https://github.com/meshy/django-schema-graph) is also pretty cool.

> Note both are only used in development
